# JavaScript30

One fun JavaScript project each day for 30 days. https://javascript30.com/

Day 19 & 20: You'll need a live server/localhost to make it work in the browser.

Day 21: The GeolocationCoordinates.heading and GeolocationCoordinates.speed features are available only in secure contexts (HTTPS), in some or all supporting browsers.
Can be tested using xcode by simulating an iPhone device.
