    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); //100 100

    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // Wes Wes

    console.log(name, name2); //wesley Wes

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team); //
    console.log(players); //Lux --> team is not the array just a reference to the original array
    
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //pass no arguments, it will make a copy of the original array
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person); //person will have number also

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 22 });
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(person); //number not added

    //object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person, number: 33};
    console.log(cap3);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',

      }
    }
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); //not a reference, will not update the original
    dev.name = 'Wesley';

    //but:
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(wes); //social.twitter gets updated here when we are using Object.assign, because it goes only 1 level deep

    //cheat solution:
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
